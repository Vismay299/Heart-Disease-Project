# Heart Disease Predection Using Machine Learning
 
## Overview
This is a simple Classification task to predict whether someone has heart disease or not. The trained model takes 13 features as input (which include 303 rows and 13 columns) to output ) or 1 in the target column. Here 0 represents that the person does not have heart disease and 1 represents that the person has heart disease. I have achieved a maximum accuracy of 88% with Logistic Regression model.

## Motivation
What could have been the perfect way to utilize the unfortunate lockdown period? Like most of the people i sepent my time cooking, Netflix, coding and reading some research parers now and then. The idea od classifing Heart Disease come from when I across a plethora of papers where scholars were trying to increase the accuracy using different models and techniques. This is my first project , my first step into this huge ocean of data science so this led me to try my own hand at this dataset and create my very first machine learning model.

## Model Comparison

* I have used 3 algorithm Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbours

* From the base Estimators we can see that the Logistic Regression and Random forest had a higher accuracy of above 80% and KNN algorithm gave an accuracy of 70%

* Hence I went to Hyperparameter Tuning of Logistic Regression and Random Forest which gace an accuracy of 88% and 85% respectively.
  
##  Conclusion 

This project would not have been possible if not for the various notebooks on Kaggle.com where people had uploaded their own implementation of the same dataset. Understanding their thought process played a major role in shaping my project. Finally my end goal is to deploy this model on the web so that people are able to predict their  chances of getting a heart disease or not.
